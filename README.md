# analyzing_press_releases
By analyzing 1,432 press releases form 10 companies, it is shown that results announcements increase stock prices volatility and trading volume by 102% and 120% respectively on the trading day right after the announcement. While stock prices volatility quickly drops after the first day, trading volume remains at a level 25–30% above average within the next 3 to 5 days after the announcements. This provides a useful guidance to companies if are considering a stock or debt offering, when they need a combination of high trading volume and low stock price volatility. For the press releases other than results announcements, the impact to either stock price and trading volume is insignificant. I also tried to use a Naïve Bayes model to classify whether a press release would create significant impact, and the result is unsatisfactory (accuracy score: 0.61).
